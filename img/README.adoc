### 3. Security:

This application is secured using `express-session` and `bcrypt`. This way it is save against the most common attacks and your security cameras will not be more attackable
by deploying this application. The `registration form` and `login form` are located in separate ejs views for simplified modification.

### 4. Persistence:

As you can see in the following screenshot, user passwords will be secured using bcrypt. You also have a role system which uses `integers` in the database, 
but in the backend you can simply map them to `strings`, such as `ADMIN`, `DEV`, `USER`.
