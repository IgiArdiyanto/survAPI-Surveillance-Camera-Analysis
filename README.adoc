## ‚ö° Introduction:

This implementation demonstrates a Security-Camera Software which was written in javascript
and uses `cocossd` offered by `ml5` to detect objects.

Check out https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/survAPI-Surveillance-Camera-Analysis/tree/main/img[this link to see all screenshots]

## ‚ùì Problem:

A business needs a security camera, but is low on server capacity. Thatswhy the business
can not store videos 24/7.

## üí° Solution:

Using Machine Learning, we can tell the camera when it has objects in view and use a lightweight
backend to store the timestamps and also the type of objects which where detected. 

#### Classification:
After detection, the software later classifies them as certain targets. 

#### Persistence

If the classified object is one of the targets, it will be persisted in the database
by giving information on its type and also adding a timestamp and date. Now we know
when to start recording and stop after a predefined amount of time passed.

## üí™ Improvements over conventional Security Cameras:

* installation is very easy and very customizable due to Open Source Technology
* a clean webinterface makes your cameras accessible and configurable
* detection of persons is a standard problem of Machine Learning and already has a very high precision
* destroy video material in which nothing happens, you will only store critical/important moments

## üèÜ Features:

‚≠ê advance your security by getting additional information from your camera.
  
‚≠ê super simple setup.

‚≠ê modern dashboard and webpages to access the cameras.

‚≠ê combine any hardware with this software.

‚≠ê SurvAPI: The included surveillance API also offers all of the analysis tool to be called from other frameworks.

‚≠ê lightweight and fast.

‚≠ê optimized amount of video data.

‚≠ê Machine Learning used to detect certain targets.

‚≠ê predefine intervals to control data produced by the camera.

‚≠ê very simple database structure.

## ü§ù Contribution:

If you want to contribute, you need to `fork` this repository and write clean commits. What do I mean with clean commits?

* Commits should not change different parts of the application, as long as they are not part of a specific problem which the commit tries to solve.
* Commit messages should always be written using the english language.
* Each commit message should be less than 50 letters and only describe one aspect.
* Commits should not be too long. Please do not change 30 files in one commit.
* There should be a minimum of understanding, what the business problem in this case is.
* You should be able to keep the architecture and not contribute beginner's code. (I am happy if a beginner contributes, because participating in a project can bring you further, but code should be readable, efficient and follow some principles)

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture:

The project will be separated into the subsystems `Camera`, `Surveillance`, `Database`, `Webviews` where each subsystem exactly solves one
of the given business problems.

To guarantee clean code, this project will profit from `Domain Driven Design` and from `Self Contained System`'s.

#### Camera:

The subsystem will fulfill the `HARDWARE`-part in this project. All types of cameras (which you find right below under `Compatibility`) will be connected via this subsystem.
It defines a domain model which projects the real world properties of cameras into code and offers its configured cameras to all of the other subsystems. All of the input
will run through this subsystem.

#### Surveillance:

The surveillance will process video material received from any video source, configured in the `Camera` subsystem. It makes use of `ML5` and analyses the material
based on the admins preferences. The analysis results will be persisted in the `Database` subsystem. It usually is not a separate subsystem, but for this project it
will do best if the database can completely be substituted behind an interface which connects the `Webviews` and the `Surveillance` to it.

#### Database:

Use any type of database you want and store all of the analysis results. You can access the persisted data by using the `Webviews` or build your own UI to access it.

#### Webviews:

Basically a frontend which can be accessed from any webbrowser. You can configure the cameras, inspect detections in a nice way and get watch live material from 
your surveillance cameras.

## üîß Compatibility:

* [ ] IP Security Camera
* [ ] Analog MPX Security Camera
* [ ] Analog MPX Wireless Security Camera
* [ ] Wire-Free Security Camera Wiring
* [x] Wi-Fi Security Camera Wiring

#### Problem:

This security software has to become a module in security networks which is located between the actual video
input device and the DVR if the video input device is not wireless or NVR if the video input device is wireless.


#### Example Network (IP Security Camera):

image::https://www.lorextechnology.com/images/articles/content/HowToInstall/v2/images/Installation-diagrams_IP-G.png[width=600]

In this system of an IP Security Camera you will find a cable which connects the NVR and the video input device by 
using power-over-ethernet (POE) technology to https://www.lorextechnology.com/articles/how-to-install["provide both power and video transmission"].

This setup leaves no space for an external software which directly controls the video input stream. This problem is
architectural and has to be solved by this software to achieve the highest possible compatibility.

#### Solution:

* 1. Backwards Integration:

When using the Backwards Integration, the software should be run on a server which is directly connected to the
DVR/NVR and will rewatch the video material recorded, filter unimportant video information and redirect it
either to the DVR/NVR or to the server to reduce the amount of data saved.

* 2. Automated Video Analysis:

Using this method, the software is run on a server just as in the previous example. The software will then 
rewatch the video information received from the DVR/NVR and collect timestamps which flag video intervals in which
target objects could be detected. You can then either keep your videos as they are or use the time stamps to
remove unimportant sequences.

More solutions have to come, but at the moment there is no idea to manipulate the video input stream between the 
video input device and the DVR/NVR, which would be the ultimate use-case for this software.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Planned Features:

* [ ] SurvAPI, an API which will offer all of the information to the filesystem or to Web requests
* [ ] cloud support
* [ ] support of various sensors
* [ ] UI to manage connected devices / settings
* [ ] server implementation to offer a central responsibility for persistence (server 1:n cameras nets)
