# Security Cam

## Introduction:

This implementation demonstrates a Security-Camera Software which was written in javascript
and uses `cocossd` offered by `ml5` to detect objects.

## Problem:

A business needs a security camera, but is low on server capacity. Thatswhy the business
can not store videos 24/7.

## Solution:

Using Machine Learning, we can tell the camera when it has objects in view and use a lightweight
backend to store the timestamps and also the type of objects which where detected. 

#### Classification:
After detection, the software later classifies them as certain targets. 

#### Persistence

If the classified object is one of the targets, it will be persisted in the database
by giving information on its type and also adding a timestamp and date. Now we know
when to start recording and stop after a predefined amount of time passed.

# Improvements over conventional Security Cameras:

* installation is very easy and very customizable due to Open Source Technology
* detection of persons is a standard problem of Machine Learning and already has a very high precision
* destroy video material in which nothing happens, you will only store critical/important moments
